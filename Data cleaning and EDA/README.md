When we merge the 'redshift' and 'vou' datasets using names, we obtain a dataframe that doesn't have missing values. In the data cleaning step, I addressed all outliers related to 'nufnu', 'nufnu_upper', and 'nufnu_lower'. For instance, I removed rows where 'nufnu' was zero but 'nufnu_upper' had large values, and I also deleted rows where 'nufnu_upper' was lower than 'nufnu'. Additionally, I removed the 'nufnu_lower' and 'nufnu_lower' features due to their high correlation with the 'nufnu' value. I retained only the 'nufnu' and 'nufnu_err' features.If I understand correctly, there is something wrong with the 'start_time' and 'end_time' features, so I decided to delete these features
